    <h3>DEALZ22 DRAW TERMS (&quot;DRAW TERMS&quot;)</h3>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>In addition to your agreement with the Terms, the following provisions apply with respect to you participating in our contest draws (&quot;Draw(s)&quot;) and winning the prizes (&quot;Prize(s)&quot;).</p>
    <p>We may amend these draw terms at any point in time without notice and the amendments will take effect once they have been displayed on the Platform. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review these draw Terms periodically to familiarize yourself with any modifications. Your continued use of the Platform and/or entry into draws following any amendments shall be construed as acceptance of those amendments.</p>
    <p>Where Draws are being run from any other jurisdiction outside India where we operate from, Dealz22 will obtain the necessary regulatory requirements and permits as stipulated by the law in such jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Only users with a valid Membership to the Platform that satisfies all the Terms are eligible to enter into our draw.</p>
    <p>The types of Draw vary on the Platform. Each product purchased on the Dealz22 App in accordance with these Terms is associated with a specific type of Draw whereby a user is awarded at least a single complimentary ticket (&quot;Ticket&quot;) to that specified draw after purchasing the product.</p>
    <p>If you purchase a product on the Dealz22 App, you will have the option to either wish to collect the purchased product or pay an additional fee to have the purchased product delivered to a India-based address of your choice by a delivery partner of our choice, if the address is other than the one provided during registration.</p>
    <p>To collect your product, you must visit our premises within fifteen (15) calendar days from purchasing the product and present your valid identification (such as your national identification card, passport, driver&apos;s license, etc.) as may be required at our sole discretion. Dealz22 may, at its sole discretion, allow an individual who has been given a written, valid and effective Power of Attorney (POA) by you to collect the product, subject to them presenting the necessary identification. Dealz22 will evaluate any such reliance on a POA on a case-by-case basis and cannot guarantee that an individual with a POA from you will be allowed to collect the product on your behalf. Failure to collect the purchased product within this time frame will result in such product being donated to charity.</p>
    <p>Ticket numbers are computer generated and may not be sequential to the order in which the products they are associated with are purchased. You cannot choose Ticket numbers as they are generated only upon checkout and completion of purchase of the associated products.</p>
    <p>Tickets awarded to you through your use of our platform are neither refundable nor transferable and are owned solely and exclusively by you.</p>
    <p>The length of each Draw varies and the date when the Prizes are awarded can occur on any day of the week for the Draws that have &apos;sold out&apos; a minimum of 24 hours prior to the day of the Draw. The Draw shall be randomly generated &nbsp;and picked by the algorithm developed by Dealz22 specifically for the purpose, as such the results of any Draw are not subject to negotiation, interference, challenge, or argument by a user. The Draw date will be solely the discretion of Dealz22.</p>
    <p>The deadline to enter any Draw using your Ticket is prior to the sell-out of all products specified within the Draw, or prior to the closure of the Draw (which happens before the Draw date); or, in the case of a timed Draw, prior to the end of the timer displayed on the campaign box of the specific Draw. The period of the Draws can be extended at Dealz22&apos;s sole discretion, and we will notify you of any such extension.</p>
    <p>Winners of the Draws are selected by the random generator and will be notified on the day the Draw occurs. The names of winners may also be announced the Platform and our associated social (online) media profiles, unless you specifically advise us otherwise in writing prior to the Draw. Unless otherwise specified, the number of winners per Draw will always be one (1).</p>
    <p>On the Draw day, an email will be sent to the registered email on the Platform detailing the next steps and how you can claim the Prize, which may include the following:</p>
    <p>In the event the winner is based in India, then he/she needs to collect the Prize from our premises within sixty (60) calendar days and present valid identification as may be required, in our sole discretion, in order to collect the Prize. Failure to collect the Prize within this time period WILL result in us transferring the Prize to the address provided by the winner during registration with an express registered authorisation to do so, on behalf of the winner at the cost of the winner. Accordingly, all local taxes, custom duties, and any other form of expense will be paid by the winner, after which Dealz22 will have no further responsibility with respect to the Prize.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the event a winner does not reside in India, we will either courier the Prize to the winner by air or land (as we may determine in our sole discretion), or ship the Prize to the winner&apos;s country of residence (nearest seaport as selected by us in our sole discretion) at the cost of the winner. Accordingly, all local taxes, custom duties, and any other form of expense will be paid by the winner.</p>
    <p>Once a Prize is handed to/collected by the courier/handler for international delivery, risk and responsibility will transfer to the winner and we no longer hold claim nor responsibility for any damage/injury incurred in transit, or upon delivery.</p>
    <p>By entering the Draw, all winners consent to the use of any and all content made by or provided to us. This includes but is not limited to the use of their name, photographs, videos, call recordings and other material created during the Draw, in the local and regional press, on the Platform and on any social (online) media profile associated with us. You may choose to withdraw your consent at any time, but this may affect your entrance into a Draw.</p>
    <p>All Prizes displayed on our Platform will be awarded, as displayed, with only minor (if any) physical changes.</p>
    <p>Where the registration or transfer of ownership of a Prize is necessary, such registration or transfer of ownership will be made against the name of the winner only, as it appears on the winning ticket. By entering the Draw of a Prize where registration or transfer of ownership is necessary, you agree that you meet the required government and regulatory criteria to receive such registration or transfer of ownership.</p>
    <p>If any winner is subsequently found ineligible to participate in the Draw, we may at our sole discretion reclaim the Prize or dispose of the same in such a manner and to such person as we deem fit. All such decisions will be in line with applicable laws.</p>
    <p>We will not be responsible for arranging any insurance, including travel insurance, medical insurance, transport, meals, or any other expenses of a personal nature incurred by the winner in the collection of the Prize, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing.</p>
    <p>We will not be responsible for claims, damages, or expenses of any nature whatsoever for any loss, illness, bodily injury, including death, of or to any winner and/or any third-party during and/or in course of usage of any Prize or due to any defects in any Prizes.</p>
    <p>Winners are responsible for any and all tax liability where applicable.</p>
